## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe that you have found a vulnerability in jte, first please search the GitHut issues list (for both open and closed issues) to see if it has already been reported.

If it has not, then please contact me (matkollin@gmail.com) directly. Please do not report any suspected vulnerabilities via GitHub issues as we wish to keep our users secure while a patch is implemented and deployed.
